# PhoneParser

I have made the assumption that the national prefix will always be 1 digit

I have made the assumption that the line "the User Number is +1212233200" in the scenario UK to US should have been omitted.

I had changed the constructor to be private (I could leave the constructor as public and not have the singleton pattern)

I had changed the the Map<String, Integer> countryCodes to Map<String, String> countryCodes.
